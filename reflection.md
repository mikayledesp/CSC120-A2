What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

The transistion from procedural to object oriented programming was very disorienting for me. I think really sitting down and brainstorming with my peers Lilly, Alanna and Marry was extremely helpful in giving me a more general direction on how to write me code. I also watched tons of youtube videos on doing java object oriented programing! In the future, I would reccomend people really go to office hours since the directions in this assignment were more open ended then the ones in CSC 110.
